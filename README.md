# Human Eyes

**An interactive AI artifact demonstrating stepwise, human-like dialogue comprehension.**

---

## Concept

Human Eyes simulates how an AI can process conversations **line by line**, like a human reading sequentially.  
It emphasizes:

- **Stepwise reasoning** – avoids misinterpreting large blocks of text.  
- **Contextual awareness** – maintains meaning across dialogue steps.  
- **Clarity and guidance** – presents output in an understandable, interactive format.  
- **Epistemic reliability** – encourages accurate, structured interpretation.

## Purpose

- Showcase human-centered AI reading and understanding.  
- Highlight design principles for **AI-human alignment**.  
- Serve as a **recruiter-visible artifact**: interactive, structured, and thoughtful.

## How It Works

1. Processes input **line by line**, maintaining context and meaning.  
2. Simulates **human-like reading** of dialogues.  
3. Supports optional **interactive prompts** or demo scripts.
